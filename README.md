This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Groovy related to implicit type coercion. The `myMethod` function is intended to operate on String arguments, including null values. However, when presented with a list, Groovy attempts implicit coercion which leads to unexpected results, instead of throwing an exception or indicating a type mismatch.  The solution showcases how to explicitly check the argument type or utilize more robust type handling to prevent such errors.
